# Data Manipulation


## Introduction:
This set of tasks involves the manipulation of data using MySQL database. The primary objective of these tasks is to serve as a guide for understanding the various aspects of data manipulation within MySQL tables. Through these tasks, I have gained insights in areas such as replacing data, modifying data, merging data, and data cleaning.

## Problem statement:
1. replace the department ‘communication’ with ‘stakeholders’ and show the result of the replacement done.

2. Update the ‘name’ column ensuring that the values are all in UPPER CASE.

3. Run a query that will show the employer's name and DOE in one column as the Employer’s brief.

4. Run a query that will remove leading spaces from the name column If exists.

## Result/Discussion:

The above snapshot clearly shows the changes made to the 'Department', and the command used for this task is as follows:

_UPDATE table_name_

_SET department = 'stakeholders'_

_WHERE department = 'communication';_
